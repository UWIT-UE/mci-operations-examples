# mci-operations-examples
Examples and practices for MCI operations. Please browse.

Here we'd like to assemble examples and illustrations of various best practices for MCI. We often point peers to real-world examples in our own repos which are often confusing and maybe are not the current best practice.

Candidates for inclusion:
- various deployment types
- cronjobs
- secrets handling
- prometheus rules (especially these)
- flux automation
- maybe app instrumentation
